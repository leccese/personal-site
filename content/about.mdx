 # hi, I'm Isabel Leccese

I love solving problems and I'm lucky to have access to humanity's finest problem-solving platform - the modern web 

unfortunately, many user experiences on the web absolutely suck and I'd like to change that

I'm currently working at [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/), creating a framework for embedding third-party web applications inside of athenaNet (athena's electronic health record)

you can check out what I've been learning and thinking about in my <Link to="/digital-garden">digital garden</Link> - a collection of work-in-progress notes

outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and cooking

you won't be able to find me on social media :)
but you can contact me at isabel@isabel.tech
