# hi, I'm Isabel Leccese

I love solving problems and I'm lucky to have access to humanity's finest problem-solving platform - the modern web

unfortunately, many user experiences on the web absolutely suck and I'd like to change that

my tools of choice are typically React and python but I've been branching out to learn Svelte and Clojure

I'm currently working at [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/), creating a framework for embedding third-party web applications inside of athenaNet (athena's electronic health record)

you can check out what I've been learning and thinking about in my <Link to="/digital-garden">digital garden</Link> - a collection of work-in-progress notes

outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, running, and cooking. I also enjoy drawing and I've recently started creating digital art - all the drawings on this site are created by me

you won't be able to find me on social media :)
but you can contact me at isabel@isabel.tech
