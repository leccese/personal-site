 # hi, I'm Isabel Leccese

I love solving problems and consider myself very fortunate to have access to humanity's finest problem-solving platform - the modern web 

in particular, I enjoy creating delightful user interfaces in ReactJS

I'm currently working at [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/) athenahealth, creating a framework for embedding third-party web applications inside of athenaNet (athena's electronic health record)

you can check out what I've been learning and thinking about in my <Link to="/digital-garden">digital garden</Link> - a collection of work-in-progress notes

outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and cooking

you won't be able to find me on social media :)
but you can contact me at isabel@isabel.tech
