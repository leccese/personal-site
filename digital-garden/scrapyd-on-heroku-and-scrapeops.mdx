If you're looking for the dead simplest way to host and schedule a scrapy project for free, see my post on heroku scheduler. Otherwise, I recommend using scrapyd + ScrapeOps for a more robust system with monitoring (also free!)

# Overview

run scrapyd on heroku https://towardsdatascience.com/a-minimalist-end-to-end-scrapy-tutorial-part-iv-3290d76a2aef
alternative way I think is easier, using herokuify_scrapyd https://scrapeops.io/python-scrapy-playbook/scrapy-beginners-guide-deployment-monitoring-alerting-scheduling/
