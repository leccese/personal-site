For anyone that has even a passing experience programming in a unix-like environement, trying to program on a windows machine has previously been a painful process.

But Microsoft has put an end to the dark ages with the release of [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## WSL2

WSL2 is linux *inside* windows. It provides the power which was previously only available by dual booting linux, but with a simple and seamless experience. Even if you know little to nothing about linux, you can easily install the default ubuntu distribution with [one command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

I think WSL2 is a big win for any software engineers (and aspiring software engineers, because it's so easy to setup!) who aren't sold on the apple ecosystem. 

## My environment setup

The big picture is:

1. windows installations
    - I do almost all of my development on linux but there are still some things to install on the windows side like:
        - a decent terminal like hyper
        - choco
        - vscode
        - browsers
        - node
        - a devent basic text editor like sublime
2. install WSL2
    - it's as easy as `wsl --install` then setup your linux user
    - see [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for details
3. linux installations

TODO: details and install scripts (so next time I have to set things up from scratch, it will be easy)
