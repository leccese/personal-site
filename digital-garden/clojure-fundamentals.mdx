Before learning Clojure, I had little interest in learning *how* a programming language works, beyond what I needed to know to build the application in question. Most languages have so many different features that reasoning how a compiler for that language might work is overwhelming. On the other hand, Clojure has so few features that I couldn't help but ask how it can accomplish so much with so little.

What follows is my working understanding of how Clojure works. Clojure is elegantly simple, but my current understanding is definitely an oversimplification.

---

In Clojure, everything is an expression (a.k.a form) that evaluates to a value. 

Expressions which exclusively perform side effects (like printing) return `nil`.

How Clojure evaluates each expression depends on the kind of expression.

# Kinds of Expressions

## Literals

Literal representations of primitives (i.e. integers, strings, lists) are all valid Clojure expressions. 

Most literal expressions evaluate to themselves, except symbols and lists. 

Symbols are used to refer to something else and when evaluated, return what they refer to. Lists are evaluated as calls (see Operations below). 

You can suspend evaluation of a symbol or list by using a single quote:

```clojure
user=> (def greeting 'hi')
#'user/greeting
user=> greeting
hi'
user=> 'greeting
greeting
user=> (1 2 3) ;; since this is unquoted, Clojure will try to call 1 as a function
Execution error (ClassCastException) at user/eval3 (REPL:1).
class java.lang.Long cannot be cast to class clojure.lang.IFn (java.lang.Long is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap'; clojure.lang.IFn is in unnamed module of loader 'app')
user=> '(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
```

Since literals don't *do anything*, you'll usually find them in operations.

## Operations

All operations (a.k.a calls) have the following form:

**(operator operand1 operand2 ... operandn)**

Depending on the operator, Clojure will treat the operation as a:

1. Special form
2. Macro call
3. Function call

When Clojure comes across an operation, first it checks if the operator is a name of a special form or a macro, otherwise it treats the operation like a function call.

### Function calls

Function calls are the default case and they follow standard Clojure evaluation. Clojure will recursively evaluate each operand before passing them to the function.

Special forms and macros are used for functionality that can't be implemented with functions because they require evaluations rules which differ from standard Clojure evaluation.

### Special forms

Special forms are primitives built-in to Clojure.

For example, it would be impossible to implement a if/else flow structure with a function, because both branches would be evaluated before being passed to the function.

```clojure
;; won't work
(defn if-function
    [test if-branch then-branch] ;; <-- all of these would get evaluated before being passed to if-function
    ...
)
```

That's why `if` is implemented as a special form.

### Macro calls

Macros are special functions that can manipulate expressions before they are evaluated. 

When a macro function is called, it is passed the unevaluated operand expressions. The macro manipulates those expressions, returning a new expression. That new expression is in evaluated in its place.

This essentially allows the syntax of the language to be expanded.

Macros can be user defined, but many primitives in Clojure you might expect to be special forms are actually macros.

For example, consider the special form `if`. There is another special form `do` which allows a block of expressions to be evaluated. Since only the return value of the last expression is returned from do, this is usually used to allow for side effects.

We might use `if` with `do` like:
```clojure
(if success
    (do (println "success!")
    true
    )
)
```
Clojure has a macro `when` which combines `if` and `do`. 

If I tried to write `when` as a function
```clojure
user=> (defn my-when-fn [test & expressions] (if test (do expressions)))
#'user/my-when-fn
user=> (my-when-fn true (println "yes!") "success")
yes!
(nil "success")
user=> (my-when-fn false (println "yes!") "success")
yes!
nil
```
it wouldn't work for a couple reasons:

1. The expression `println "yes!"` gets evaluated regardless of whether `test` is `true` or `false`. This is because `my-when-fn` is a function and `expressions` is an operand of that function, each expression in `expressions` will get evaluated before it is passed to `my-when-fn`

2. In the `true` case, instead of just returning `success`, it returns `(nil "success")`. This is because expressions is a list, so instead of `(println success)` and `"success"` because passed to `do` as separate arguments, do is being passed one argument `((println success) "success")`. Since `do` is a special form, not a function which we can use `apply` on, there is no way to pass the contents of `expressions` to `do` without using a macro

Therefore, `when` is implemented as a macro:
```clojure
(defmacro when
  "Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."
  {:added "1.0"}
  [test & body]
  (list 'if test (cons 'do body)))
```
