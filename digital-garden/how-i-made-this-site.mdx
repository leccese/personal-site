Here's the repo of this site on github: https://github.com/leccese/personal-site    

I landed on using Gatsby based on the following criteria:

- **super easy setup** - the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) holds your hand through the process of creating a blog-like site. and since this site had remainly merely an *idea* for way too long, this low friction setup was exactly what I needed to actually publish something
    - arguably, something like a wordpress site would be even easier but I know that the limitations would annoy the hell out of me
- **nice DX** - all the nifty things you might want in a blog like using MDX and deploying a new version by push to github work out of the box
- **major problems I've heard about Gatsby don't apply to me** - I don't see myself needed dynamic content anytime soon and I don't care that deploys can take 20 min. in order words, my site is a good use case for Gatsby
- **new tech to me but not super new** - I never used Gatsby before so I wanted to see what the deal is but it's still well within my wheelhouse of React

I'm hosting on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) because I set it up as part of the tutorial and [free tier](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/pricing#plan-FREE) is pretty generous so I haven't found a reason not to use it yet
